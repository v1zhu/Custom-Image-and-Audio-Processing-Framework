**Custom Image & Audio Processing Framework - Programming and Basic Data Structures for Data Science (DSC 20)**

This project implements a modular, object-oriented system for processing and classifying multimedia data, including RGB images and 1D audio waveforms. It features a tiered image/audio processing pipeline
and a custom K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) image classifier built from scratch.


**Technologies & Concepts**  
Python (OOP): Classes, inheritance, encapsulation  
Data Structures: Lists, nested data structures  
Algorithm Design: Distance metrics, sorting, voting systems  
Testing: Doctests embedded in class method  
Command Line Development: Terminal-based file I/O for testing  

**Features**  
1. Image Processing  
 Grayscale conversion  
 Brightness adjustment  
 180Â° rotation  
 Pixelation effect  
 Edge highlighting  

2. Audio Processing  
   Audio reversal  
   Speed up / slow down by factor  
   Echo/reverb effect  
   Song clipping by percentage  

3. Image Classification  
   K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier  
   Uses Euclidean distance over pixel data  
   Predicts image labels based on training dataset folders
